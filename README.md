A dialog is a small window that prompts the user to make a decision or enter additional information. A dialog does not fill the screen and is normally used for modal events that require users to take an action before they can proceed.

How to create a Custom Dialog box in android?

I have tried the following things.

I created a subclass of AlertDialog.Builder and used a custom Title and Custom Content View and used that but the result was not as expected.

Another attempt was to subclass DialogFragment and customize the dialog inside onCreateDialog that but result was not as expected.

Then I tried using a plain Dialog class. The result was not as expected.
